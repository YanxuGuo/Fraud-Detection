# Fraud-Detection
The goal of this project is to build a fraud detection model to achieve a relatively high accuracy of the Card Transaction Data. The whole process goes through the steps of data description, data cleaning, variable creation, feature selection, model exploration, Final model performance displacement, and finally a financial curves and recommended cutoff is presented. After doing all the steps above, a final model of Random Forest is chosen, with top 20 features, n_estimator=100, criterion=gini, max_depth=15, min_samples_leaf=200, and max_deatures=log2. The model could achieve a Training accuracy of 0.759, a Testing accuracy rate of 0.726, and a OOT of 0.531. The model can capture 53.1% of all the fraud at the top 3 percent. After drawing the financial curves, we recommend a score cutoff at 3%, where we achieve a maximum overall savings at 19,332,000.
